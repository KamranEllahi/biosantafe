Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products, and counterfeit products may include products with correct ingredients or wrong ingredients, with insufficient quantity of active ingredient or with fake packaging."i Counterfeit products also include medicines that were genuinely manufactured, but where packaging or documents relating to the medicine's history/distribution were altered.ii Such products may include genuine medicines approved for sale in one market, but illegally diverted and sold elsewhere.</p>
      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <p>Counterfeit medicines can pose serious and sometimes life-threatening health risks to patients. The WHO notes that counterfeit medicines are not equivalent in quality, safety, and efficacy to genuine medicines and often do not contain any, or the correct amount of, active ingredient, and also may contain impurities.iii Additionally, counterfeit medicines may be produced in unsafe manufacturing conditionsiv and travel through insecure supply chains. Nor are counterfeits inspected by government regulators charged with the wellbeing of patients and product safety.v</p>
